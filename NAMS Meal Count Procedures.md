2. A new sheet will be added to the spreadsheet every day. The most recent day is the first tab across the bottom left of the spreadsheet.  
3. The spreadsheet is only shared with certain people.

# Technical Details

The search field in the webpage references the NAMS Criteria Sheet when it searches for a student’s name (see Henry Casanova for questions regarding the Criteria Sheet). The student data from the NAMS Criteria Sheet will be returned when the student searches for their ID or name on the webpage. The students’ medical alert code and medical alert comment are meant to provide any information regarding food allergies or restrictions.   
The webpage is built using Google Apps Script. The script can be found in the NAMS Meal Count sheet by going to Extensions then Apps Script in the menu bar.

# Student Directions

1. Enter your S\# or Name in the field.  
2. Click the blue “Search” button or hit the “enter” key.  
3. When your name is found, it will appear underneath the search field.  
   1. If it isn’t found, you will see a message that the name was not found. Re-enter your S\# or search with your name.  
   2. If your name is still not found, you are not on the NAMS Criteria sheet, the name on the list is misspelled, or the ID\# on the sheet doesn’t match.
